Design Principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TODS follows the design principal of `D3M <http://datadrivendiscovery.org/>`_.
The toolkit wraps each function into ``Primitive`` class with unified 
interfaces. The goal of this toolkit is to enable the users to easily develop
outlier detection system for time series data. The following design principles 
are applied when developing the toolkit: 
 * **.** Results on the environments can be reproduced. The same result should be obtained with the same random seed in different runs. 
 * **Accessible.** The experiences are collected and well organized after each game with easy-to-use interfaces. Uses can conveniently configure state representation, action encoding, reward design, or even the game rules. 
 * **Scalable.** New card environments can be added conveniently into the toolkit with the above design principles. We also try to minimize the dependencies in the toolkit so that the codes can be easily maintained.
